# acms-plugin-skeleton

A starter skeleton for developing an **a-blog cms** plugin. It is based on the `SamplePlugin`
bundled with a-blog cms, lightly modernized, and comes with a ready-to-run **PHPUnit** setup
(`appleple/acms-testing-framework`).

## Requirements

- **Production:** PHP 8.1 – 8.5 (`require.php` is `^8.1`).
- **Development / CI:** PHP 8.5 (`config.platform.php` is `8.5.0`; the bundled Docker image is
  `php8.5`). Coding standards (phpcs) and static analysis (phpstan) check the whole 8.1 – 8.5 range.

## What's inside

| File / dir | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/ServiceProvider.php` | Plugin registration (hooks, correctors, validators, admin templates). |
| `src/GET/Sample.php` | Example display module (`<!-- BEGIN_MODULE Sample -->`). Thin; delegates to a service. |
| `src/POST/Sample.php` | Example action module (`ACMS_POST_Sample`). |
| `src/Modules/Get/V2/Sample.php` | Example V2 (Twig) module returning a data array; call via `module('V2_Sample')`. |
| `src/Hook.php` | Extension points (e.g. `extendsGlobalVars`, `extendsTwig`). |
| `src/Corrector.php` | Custom template output filter, e.g. `{var}[sample('...')]`. |
| `src/Validator.php` | Custom form validator (with `#[AsValidationOption]`). |
| `src/Services/SampleService.php` | Business logic extracted so it can be unit tested. |
| `src/template/…` | Twig settings screen (`acms_config`) + module config/select templates. |
| `tests/` | `Unit/` (no DB) and `Integration/` (DB, auto rollback). |
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | Sample CI workflow. |

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Generate your plugin from this skeleton (you'll be asked for a name).
composer create-project appleple/acms-plugin-skeleton my-awesome-plugin
cd my-awesome-plugin

# 2. Start a-blog cms + MySQL.
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
# → open http://localhost:8080 and finish the setup wizard

# 3. Run the tests (from /workspace, where the whole repo is mounted).
docker compose exec acms bash -lc "cd /workspace && composer install && vendor/bin/phpunit"
```

## Layout

Production code lives in **`src/`**, tests in **`tests/`**, and config files at the repository root.

```

├── phpunit.xml.dist
├── docker-compose.yml
└── .github/workflows/test.yml
```

`src/` **is the plugin root**: when a-blog cms runs, `extension/plugins/{Name}/` points at this
repository's `src/` (a symlink or bind-mount — `docker-compose.yml` does exactly this). The core
autoloader maps `Acms\Plugins\ → extension/plugins/`, so `Acms\Plugins\Skeleton\ServiceProvider`
resolves to `src/ServiceProvider.php`. That is why classes under `src/` carry no extra `src`
namespace segment (e.g. `src/Services/SampleService.php` is `Acms\Plugins\Skeleton\Services\SampleService`).

The `ServiceProvider` must be resolvable by the core autoloader alone: when a plugin is activated,
a-blog cms instantiates `Acms\Plugins\{Name}\ServiceProvider` before the plugin's own autoloader is
available. It sits at the top of `src/` for that reason.

## Testing

Keep handlers thin and move logic into services, then test the services.

| Target | Test? | Base class |
|---|---|---|
| `Services/*` pure logic | ✅ Unit | `Acms\Testing\TestCase` |
| DB-backed logic | ✅ Integration | `Acms\Testing\DatabaseTestCase` |
| `GET/*` / `POST/*` / V2 modules | ❌ | covered indirectly via services |

Test data is created with `Acms\Testing\Seeder\*` (Blog / Category / User / Entry / …). Integration
tests run inside a transaction that is rolled back automatically.

The PHPUnit bootstrap comes from the testing framework: `phpunit.xml.dist` points at
`vendor/appleple/acms-testing-framework/bootstrap.php`, so there is no `tests/bootstrap.php` to
maintain. If you need custom setup, add a `tests/bootstrap.php` that `require`s that shared entry and
point `bootstrap` in `phpunit.xml.dist` back at it.

### Running tests against your own core

Set `ACMS_ROOT` in `phpunit.xml.dist` to your a-blog cms root (inside Docker, the container path).
Provide the test database connection via the core's `.env.testing`
(`ACMS_DB_HOST` / `ACMS_DB_NAME` / `ACMS_DB_USER` / `ACMS_DB_PASS`).

```bash
composer install
vendor/bin/acms-create-database   # create the test DB tables (first run only)
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Quality checks

Composer scripts wrap the tooling:

```bash
composer lint      # PHP_CodeSniffer (PSR-12 + PHPCompatibility) — phpcs.xml
composer analyse   # PHPStan (level 5) — phpstan.neon.dist
composer test      # PHPUnit
composer check     # all three
composer format    # phpcbf (auto-fix coding standard)
```

PHPStan resolves a-blog cms core symbols via the extension shipped with
`appleple/acms-testing-framework`; set `scanDirectories` in `phpstan.neon.dist` to your core path
(the default matches the bundled docker-compose). For a local override, create `phpstan.neon`
(git-ignored).

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/test.yml` is a **sample** self-contained workflow: it boots a-blog cms + MySQL
with `docker-compose.yml` and runs **coding standards (phpcs), static analysis (phpstan) and tests
(phpunit)** in the container. Adjust it (image tag, PHP/DB versions) for your host, or replace it
with Bitbucket Pipelines / CircleCI if you prefer.

## Renaming

`composer create-project` runs `scripts/rename-namespace.php`, which replaces `Skeleton` /
`appleple/acms-plugin-skeleton` with your plugin name and then removes itself. To run it manually:

```bash
php scripts/rename-namespace.php MyAwesomePlugin
```
